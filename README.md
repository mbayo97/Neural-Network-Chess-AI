# Neural Network Chess AI
 Chess AI using the latest techniques, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Endgame Tablebases, and Opening Books

Deep Reinforcement Learning: This involves using neural networks to train the AI by allowing it to learn from its own experience. The AI can learn to make moves based on the rewards it receives for making good moves and the penalties it receives for making bad moves.

Monte Carlo Tree Search: This algorithm is based on random sampling and is used to evaluate moves by simulating many possible games from a given position. It is especially effective for games like chess, where the number of possible moves is large.

Endgame tablebases: Endgame tablebases are precomputed databases that contain optimal moves for chess endgames with a small number of pieces. The AI can use these tablebases to quickly determine the best moves in endgame positions.

Multi-threading: Multi-threading allows the AI to take advantage of multiple cores or processors to speed up its search. This can significantly improve the performance of the AI.

Opening books: An opening book is a database of precomputed openings and responses to openings. The AI can use an opening book to quickly make moves based on previously seen openings.
